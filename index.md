I am a freshmen at CAL STATE Fullerton where I am majoring in Business, previously in Computer Science. I am expected to graduate in 2029.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
Favorite Lab 1:

  The first lab I enjoyed was the very first lab since it was the start of something fresh and a new beginning. Not only was it something new, it was also very easy and straightforward. This lab introduced us to what was coming and what we were going to expect. We were introduced to using the terminal and coding the AUTHORS.md files as well as others. This was a very clear and easy introduction to the subjects.

Favorite Lab 2:

  Lab 2, part 1, was one of my favorite labs since it helped me understand how to use strings for user input and output in a realistic way. I liked how the program generated an entertaining Mad Lib about computers by asking the user to provide a singular noun, a plural noun, and a present-tense verb. I also discovered that line wrapping keeps the code structured and makes lengthy output lines easier to read. My comprehension of how user input alters a program's behavior and eventual output has improved as a result of working through this lab

Favortie Lab 3:

  Lab 6, part 2 was also one of my favorite labs since I enjoy playing blackjack with my friends when we have board game nights. It showed me how to turn real life games into a program. The input validation section also helped me learn how to catch errors. Overall, this lab made functions seem more practical and showed me how programming can be used to model real games.
