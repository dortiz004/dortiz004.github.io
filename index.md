## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
Favorite Lab 1:

  The first lab I enjoyed was the very first lab since it was the start of something fresh and a new beginning. Not only was it something new, it was also very easy and straight forward. This lab introduced us to what was coming and what we were going to expect. We were introduced to using the terminal and coding the AUTHORS.md files as well as others. This was a very clear and easy introduction to the subjects.
